    "lyrics": "Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs\nOf every head he's had the pleasure to know\nAnd all the people that come and go\nStop and say Hello\nOn the corner is a banker with a motorcar,\nAnd little children laugh at him behind his back\nAnd the banker never wears a mac\nIn the pouring rain, very strange\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nThere beneath the blue suburban skies\nI sit, and meanwhile back\nIn Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,\nAnd in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen\nHe likes to keep his fire engine clean,\nIt's a clean machine\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nA four of fish and finger pies\nIn summer. Meanwhile back\nBehind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout\nThe pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray\nAnd though she feels as if she's in a play,\nShe is anyway\nIn Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,\nWe see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,\nAnd then the fireman rushes in\nFrom the pouring rain - very strange\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nThere beneath the blue suburban skies\nI sit, and meanwhile back\nPenny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\nThere beneath the blue suburban skies\nPenny Lane!",

Did I need to know?\nWhy does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow?\nThe moths beat themselves to death against the lights\nAdding their breeze to the summer nights\nOutside water like air was gray\nI didn't know what I had that day\nWalk a little farther to another plan\nYou said that you did, but you didn't understand\nI know that starting over's not what life's about\nBut my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth\nMy thoughts were so loud, I couldn't hear my mouth\nMy thoughts were so loud, ah",
